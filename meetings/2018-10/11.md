# Meeting 11/10/2018

participants : AS, AP
schedule : 13h-13h30

## To present
  - build automation tool (Cargo)
  - continous integration and deployment service (Appveyor)
  - documentation standard (Javadoc + Markdown) + documentation generator tool (cargo-doc)
  - CopSub answer

## To Discuss
  - VxWorks code source
  - literature review
  - bootloader
  - shell
  - design principle (event-driven/time-sharing)
    - Event-driven – switches tasks only when an event of higher priority needs servicing; called preemptive priority, or priority scheduling
	- Time-sharing – switches tasks on a regular clocked interrupt, and on events; called round robin
	- other designs may exist, needs further reasearch
  - classification (hard/firm/soft)
	- consequence of missing a deadline : 
	  - *Hard* –  missing a deadline is a total system failure
	  - *Firm* –  infrequent deadline misses are tolerable, but may  degrade the system's quality of service. The usefulness of a result is  zero after its deadline
	  - *Soft* –  the usefulness of a result degrades after its deadline, thereby degrading the system's quality of service
  - test-driven development
  - literature review length
  - dynamic scheduling policy with strategy design pattern

## Decisions
  - hard real-time OS (or at least strong firm)
  - two level scheduling policy : short- and long-term
	* short-time : map programs to processors
	* long-time : estimate job completion time accept it or not
  - do not use VxWorks code
  - bootleader : as simple as possible
  - shell : reuse as much as possible
  - time-sharing (event-driven optional)
  - core features : IPC, scheduler, virtual memory management
