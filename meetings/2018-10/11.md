## To Discuss

- VxWorks code source
- literature review
- bootloader
- shell
- design principle (event-driven/time-sharing)
	- Event-driven – [switches tasks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_switch) only when an event of higher priority needs servicing; called [preemptive priority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preemption_(computing)), or priority scheduling.
	- Time-sharing – switches tasks on a regular clocked interrupt, and on events; called [round robin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_scheduling).
	- other designs may exist, needs further reasearch
- classification (hard/firm/soft)
	- consequence of missing a deadline: 
		- *Hard* –  missing a deadline is a total system failure.
		- *Firm* –  infrequent deadline misses are tolerable, but may  degrade the system's quality of service. The usefulness of a result is  zero after its deadline.
		- *Soft* –  the usefulness of a result degrades after its deadline, thereby degrading the system's quality of service.
- test-driven development
- literature review length
- dynamic scheduling policy with strategy design pattern
