- Rust 1.30
	- .
- apparently not collaborator on Github yet
- why so many distributed RTOS ?

## To Discuss

- Hoare logic + [Communicating sequential processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes)
- awesome idea for IPC : hash attached to a process when it is launched, generated from file path and/or file content
	- unique (even among versions of a same program)
	- constant
	- based on system calls
		- does program $NAME exists ?
		- is it running ?
		- what is its hash ?
		- initiate communication
		- or same thing but with hash instead
- firm RTOS : hard for kernel/services, soft for applications ?
