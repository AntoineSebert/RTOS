## Motivation
This project aims to create a POSIX-compliant microkernel real-time operating system using the Rust language. It addresses a large area of design techniques and algorithms so as to reach three defined goals  :

- **deterministic** execution time of the programs (or subparts of them), allowing the processes to be managed accurately
- **correctness** of the time when a result is expected, to meet or miss the deadlines, where treatment marks the difference between soft and hard RTOS
- **predictability** of the deadline associated with a set of constraints to define an expected state of the system

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
```
git clone ...
```

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests
Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests
Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests
Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment
Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
