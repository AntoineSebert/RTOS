* by **development of ideas** : this could be useful if there are identifiable stages of idea development that can be looked at in turn
* by **sector**

### IPC

two major paradigms : synchronous/asynchronous
**synchronous** (*σύν* (with, in company with, together with); *χρόνος* (time))
* requirement : participants must be available at the same time
    * corollaire : synchronization phase at first
* blocking events
* corollaire : messages order is invariant
* conjecture : short-time applications

**asynchronous** (not synchronous)
* requirement : a space to store the data must exist
* non-blocking events
* conjecture : messages order need to be explicited if it is necessary
* corollaire : receiver may not exist (error)
